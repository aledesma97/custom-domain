        <h3>What's Wrong?</h3>
        <p>Online marketplaces tend to be unkind to new users and Ebay’s desktop website is no exception. The site presents too many unnecessary visible options for the user and causes cognitive overload to users who just want to find what they are looking for, buy it and leave. The main design idea for this project was to streamline the searching and buying options for the site and only display what needed to. Essentially, I treated the redesign like I was making an app. Mobile apps tend to be more minimal and straightforward than desktop sites and working towards that was my goal for the project.</p>

    <!-- ////////// Research/Process ////////// -->

      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>I started by creating a decision tree between the landing page and search result page. I wanted to make sure the amount of decisions the user had wasn’t going to overwhelm them. I needed to lay this out before designing the layout so I wouldn’t be tempted to add more than necessary. I then made some high contrast wire frames to get a feel for how heavy the content would look on the page before completing the high-fidelity prototype. I chose to hide the categories in a hamburger menu to reduce visual clutter and to push filtering options off to the side. I also increased the size of the search bar since it is the most used component of the site and wanted to create hierarchy.</p>

    <div class="results">
      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>Ebay’s desktop website was very visually cluttered and laid every option out on the table right away. Many of the features are useful but I don’t think that they need to be visible all of the time. It made more sense to reserve them for when the customer would need them most. The majority of users head straight for the search bar when they are looking to buy something and rarely scroll all the way down to the bottom of the home page, so I wanted to simplify it’s appearance so they can easily get to what they were looking for. On the search results page I placed search filters into a dropdown menu so it can be pushed when it needed to be. I also hid other categories in a hamburger menu in the upper left, each category has its own subcategories to search specific departments.</p>
