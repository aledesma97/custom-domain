        <h3>What's Wrong?</h3>
        <p>It’s hard to immerse yourself in the world of video games when the UI looks so bland. Players should be engaged as soon as they start up the console especially with a company as forward-thinking as Nintendo.The goals for this project were to bring more personality and functionality to the home screen and news sections of the Switch to engage the target audience. Also, I wanted to implement a direct messaging function to help foster a community amongst the player base.</p>

      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>I was designing with casual gamers in mind. This is the target demographic of the device and designing for them will ensure that newcomers also feel at home using the Switch. I performed a heuristic analysis on the existing home screen to determine what needed to be changed. I needed to put myself in the shoes of the average player to understand how the design made me feel. First impressions are important, people will be very disatisfied if their $300 device is not what they expected. I also conducted interviews with multiple different users to get their input on what they liked and disliked to better justify my design decisions.</p>
      
      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>After conducting research I started to creating wireframes for each screen to focus on layout and functionality. I then conducted usability tests on these wireframes to ensure that users understood how to navigate around the system. Next came the visuals, I chose to utilize a lot of red to reflect the company’s image. Subtle changes like rounding corners were made to create shapes that invoke playfulness. Emphasis was placed on selected components by increasing their size to prevent the user from getting lost in the UI.</p>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>The original home screen lacked a lot of personality and brand identity. A subtle addition I made to the interface was incorporating Nintendo’s signature red color to some of the buttons. Instead of having a plain gray background I wanted to have the highlighted application’s thumbnail expand to take up the screen to give the player a more personal and immersive experience. I added a community tab to encourage player communication as well as an achievements feature to give players an incentive to continue playing on the system. The direct message function that I incorporated into the design features a side bar of previous chat logs on half of the screen and that selected logs on the other half. All these changed were made with the intention to make the player feel at home while on their console.</p>
