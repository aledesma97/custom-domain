      <h1>Anthony Ledesma</h1>
      <h3>Front-End Designer</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Anthony Ledesma and I am a student at Eastern Washington University studying UX and Web Design. I enjoy solving problems using my knowledge in design to help people have a greater experience with products both in the real world and on the web. I have created redesign prototypes for websites and interfaces that I felt had some user experience issues. I hope to be part of a UX design team where I can bring my teamwork and conceptualizing skills to the table and collaborate to create stunning products. Most of my work deals with digital spaces so in the future I would like to gain experience working in physical mediums. I have knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript that helps me bring my ideas to fruition. I believe the first step to solving a problem is recognizing that there is one.
